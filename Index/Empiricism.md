> aka *Mental Incorrigibility*

- Any honest statement of immediate sensory prediction is a $True$ proposition
	- Example
		- *"I feel pain in my leg"*
		- Even if this can by an illusion (for example [phantom pain](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/phantom-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20376272)) we still consider this statement a $True$ statement because it talks about our feelings about reality and not about reality itself
