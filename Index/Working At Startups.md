- [Red flags you should look out for when interviewing at small startups 🚩🚩🚩"](https://twitter.com/berman66/status/1595488319353372674)
	1. The exec team doesn’t have relevant experience in the space
	2. They won’t share metrics to show their growth
	3. It’s a “software” company, but the majority of the team is non-technical
	4. They don’t know what they’re looking for in a candidate
	5. They reschedule your interview often and take a long time to get you a yes or no answer
	6. They’ve raised a ton of capital + haven’t slowed down spending
	7. They offer stock options but won’t tell you what they’re worth
	8. The company seems to be run like a dictatorship
> 	Know your worth, go into an early-stage startup with all the facts, and try to talk to non-execs about what the employee experience is really like. Do what’s best for you, and don’t be afraid of viewing things with a lens of skepticism until you’re proven wrong.
