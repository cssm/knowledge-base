		- Different colors trigger different emotions
		- Adding blue tints to grey will make snow feel colder
		- Pink tones are very calming for many
	- Wide color displays support a `P3` color space, which can produce richer, more saturated colors than `sRGB`
	- *RGBA*
		- `R` - red, `G` - green, `B` - blue
