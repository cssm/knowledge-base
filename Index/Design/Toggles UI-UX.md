> most known type of toggle is [Switch](UISwitch.md)

- Toggle should display current state
	- only exception I think is play/pause button 
- ðŸš¨ Never use a switch to perform action - use button instead. 
	- Consider switch as a checkbox (another type of switch) for touch interfaces
	- Use switch when you have a clear two value state that not requires some extra work from the user.
