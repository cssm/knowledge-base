		- personally I use this for quite a few reasons
			1. On [iOS](../Information%20Technology/Programming/Apple%20Technologies/Apple%20Platform%20Specifics/iOS.md) all notifications disappears from lock screen after unlock and stays in notification center which is accessible by swipe. I don't like this behavior for reminders that a set to specific time - I want them to stay on lock screen until I complete them and reminder's app allows this, other app's can't do it.
			2.   Great sync between MacBook and iPhone 
			3.   Integrated deeply into [iOS](../Information%20Technology/Programming/Apple%20Technologies/Apple%20Platform%20Specifics/iOS.md) and [macOS](../Information%20Technology/Programming/OS's/macOS.md)
