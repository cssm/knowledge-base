	- personally I use this for quite a few reasons
		1. On [iOS](iOS.md) all notifications disappears from lock screen after unlock and stays in notification center which is accessible by swipe. I don't like this behavior for reminders that a set to specific time - I want them to stay on lock screen until I complete them and reminder's app allows this, other app's can't do it.
		2.   Great sync between MacBook and iPhone 
		3.   Integrated deeply into [iOS](iOS.md) and [macOS](macOS.md)
