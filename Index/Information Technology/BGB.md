> Border Gateway Protocol

- [BGP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/) stands for Border Gateway Protocol
- The Internet is literally a network of networks, and itâ€™s bound together by BGP. BGP allows one network (say Facebook) to advertise its presence to other networks that form the Internet
-  When someone types the [https://facebook.com](https://facebook.com/) URL in the browser, the DNS resolver, responsible for translating domain names into actual IP addresses to connect to, first checks if it has something in its cache and uses it. If not, it tries to grab the answer from the domain nameservers, typically hosted by the entity that owns it.
