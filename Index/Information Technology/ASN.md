> Autonomous System Number

- The individual networks each have an ASN. An Autonomous System (AS) is an individual network with a unified internal routing policy. An AS can originate prefixes (say that they control a group of IP addresses), as well as transit prefixes (say they know how to reach specific groups of IP addresses).
- Every ASN needs to announce its prefix routes to the Internet using BGP; otherwise, no one will know how to connect and where to find us
