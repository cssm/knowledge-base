- **Notes**
	- Addresses are mapped to [RAM](../Hardware/Components/RAM.md)
	- Stack pointer (`SP`)
		- points at top of the stack. used to change stack size
	- Base pointer (`BP`)
		- points at the the beginning of the `stack frame`. `stack frame` technique is used to work with functions and more precisely to form a scope for a function.   
	- Used addresses goes from higher one `FFFF` to lower one `0000`. While heap is working in another direction. Reason for this is that otherwise stack can delete some code (e.g. used by kernel space). In our situation `SP` will meet `heap pointer` (or if it eventually reaches the limit posed by `RLIMIT_STACK`) and we'll get a `stack overflow` situation
	- `stack overflow` - no free memory left for stack 
		- Modern systems terminates process if this situation happens
