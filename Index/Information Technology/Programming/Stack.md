- Addresses are mapped to [RAM](RAM.md)
- Used fixed memory addresses from `0100` to `01F`F and grows from bigger address to lower. If stack is reached `0100` address itâ€™s jumps back to `01FF` address. 
- `Stack overflow` - situation all addresses is user
	- Modern systems terminates process if this situation happens
