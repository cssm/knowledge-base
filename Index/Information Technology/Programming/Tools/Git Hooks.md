- client-side and server-side hooks
- stored in `.git/hooks/`
- not copied on repo clone
	- you can store them in some indexed directory and then make [Symbolic Link](../Symbolic%20Link.md) to those scripts in `.git/hooks/`
	- from `git 2.9` you can run `git config core.hooksPath <path_to_hooks_dir>` to setup new path to hooks instead of default `.git/hooks/` and add this path to `git` index
- can be written in any programming language
- some hooks can be skipped
	- for example `pre-commit` hook is skipped by passing  `--no-verify` flag	
		- e.g. `git commit --no-verify`
