> Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types

- **Notes**
	- Basic requirement is that we have some `merge` function 
	- Every CRDT should have this properties
		1.  *Commutativity*
			- Merging `A` into `B` should give the same result as merging `B` into `A`
		2. *[Idempotency](Idempotency.md)*
			- Say we have a network issue and we accidentally send a value multiple times. This should have the same result as merging the value once
		3. *Associativity*
			- If we have three instances of our app, it shouldn't matter whether we first merge `A` and `B` and then `C`, or if we first merge `B` and `C` and then `A`
