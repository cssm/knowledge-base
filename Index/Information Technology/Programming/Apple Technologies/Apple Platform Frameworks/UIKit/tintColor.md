> Color of [UIView](UIView.md), if no tintColor is found default value is returned (`systemBlue`)

- **Notes**
	- When alert or action sheet is presented all tinted buttons goes gray because they become not interactive. To implement custom color for disabled state use [tintColorDidChange()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622620-tintcolordidchange)
