## Animating contraints

If animating constraints (not frame sizes) we need to call `layoutIfNeeded()` for parent view (and we need to call it before starting animation, to be sure that all other view animations and changes did finished)

```swift
@IBAction func buttonTapped(_ sender: Any) {
		view.layoutIfNeeded()
		UIView.animate(withDuration: 2) {
				self.heighConstraint.constant = 250
				self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
		}
}
```

## UIView.animate()

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3) {
		button.center.x += 100
}
```

We can easily animate multiple things at once

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3) {
		button.center.x += 100
		button.frame.size.width = 200
}
```

By passing a completion closure, weâ€™re able to react to when the animation was completed

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3, animations: {
		button.center.x += 100
		button.frame.size.width = 200
}, completion: { _ in
		button.backgroundColor = .red
})
```

Another overload with delay and curve

```swift
UIView.animate(
		withDuration: 0.3, 
		delay: 0.5, 
		options: .curveEaseInOut, 
		animations: {
				button.center.x += 100
        button.frame.size.width = 200
		}, completion: { _ in
        button.backgroundColor = .red
		}
)
```
