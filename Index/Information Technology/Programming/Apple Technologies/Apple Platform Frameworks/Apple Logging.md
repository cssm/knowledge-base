> If app is running we can see logs in [Xcode](../Apple%20Platform%20Specifics/Apple%20Developer%20Tools/Xcode.md)  console
> Logging is more efficient then `print` because no strings are created (? if message is not displayed ?). Its generates compile optimized string representation (`OSLogMessage` type) using type of logged item
