- *MRC* 
	- manual reference counting
	- been used in [Objective-C](../../Objective-C.md)
- *ARC*
	- automatic reference counting 
	- modern way to count references
	- available in [Swift](../../Swift.md) and [Objective-C](../../Objective-C.md)
	- 3 counters strong unowned and weak
	- Strong and unowned variables point at the object.
	- Weak variables point at the object's side table.
	- if weak reference is created to object that object gains a side table
	- by default strong count is 1, unowned count is 1 and weak count is 1
