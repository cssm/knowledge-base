# Apple Platform Deeplinks

## Basics

### Universal links

- Uses stored on web page `apple-app-site-association file` (contains bundle id and stuff) for [[iOS]]
- Do not open browser
- Can work with any platfrom if configured propertly
- Can do stuff if app is not installed

Good candidate for sharing some info from your app across internet

### URL-scheme

- Simple, just configure `URL Types` in `App Target` â†’ `Info`

Good candidate to share some app info if you know that **app is installed** 

## Firebase Deeplinks

Looks like this: [`https://example.page.link/summer-sale`](https://example.page.link/summer-sale)

Under the hood also contains url. This url is data that we pass with deeplink. We need this url to redirect to it on unsuported platforms (by default).

- Need support both `Universal links` and `Custom scheme links` because firebase uses `url-scheme` to move user to requested screen after app's installation.
- `apple-app-site-association file` is generated by Firebase
- Deeplinks can be generated on client side, no backend needed
- Deeplink types
    - Full dynamic link (a lot of stuff, not readable, only for internal stuff)
    - Shorted link (generated by firebase, contains all url paramteres and stuff that was added)

### Testing

Be default we need a real device to test in (paste it into `Notes.app`)

```bash
xcrun simctl openurl booted <deeplink>
```
