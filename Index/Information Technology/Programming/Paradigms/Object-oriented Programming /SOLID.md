- **Notes**
	- *S*
		- *Single Responsibility Principle*
		- one class - one responsibility
	- *O*
		- *Open-Closed Principle*
		- classes are easy to gain new functionality. ideally no need to change code written before
	- *L*
		- *Liskov Substitution Principle*
		- if `B` is subtype of `A` then function with `A` parameter can take `B` as argument without breaking any code. That also means that `B` should not break functionality of `A`
	- *I*
		- *Interface Segregation Principle*
		- our interfaces contain only needed requirements 
	- *D*
		- *Dependency Inversion Principle*
		- we don't depend on concrete implementation but on some kind of abstraction (e.g interface)
