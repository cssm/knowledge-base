> Graphics Rendering process can be done efficient only by using [GPU](../Hardware/Components/GPU.md)

- **Notes**
	- `Shader` - a program that runs parallel processing of pixels on the screen
	- *we can lower the resolution of image to blur it more efficiently* (classic complexity of bluring is $O(n*r^2)$ where $n$ - number of pixels, $r$ - radius of blur
