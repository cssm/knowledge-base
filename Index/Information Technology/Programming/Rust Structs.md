	- No classes in Rust. Just wrap in `Box` struct to allocate in in heap
		- At compile time, Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up. This becomes problematicf for recursive types, where a value can have as part of itself another value of the same type. To get around the issue, we can use a `Box` - a smart pointer used to store data on the heap, which also allows us to wrap a recursive type.
