			- Tricks you with simplicity even when it's not
				- Go thinks that all paths are valid [Unicode](../../Unicode.md) (there're not) as a result they're using strings for path's everywhere
				- Go thinks that there is only `\\` separator in paths on Windows (but it's also can be just `\`)
			- Not producing valid program interfaces for different platforms 
				- We can get file permissions on Windows and it gives as `666` value (there's no file permission concept on Windows). This is a result of that it's hard to write cross-platform code in Go
			- Ignoring [Computer Science](Computer%20Science.md) concepts like [Optionals](Swift/Swift%20Notes/Optionals.md) and others
				- `int` having value of `0` by default and no [Optionals](Swift/Swift%20Notes/Optionals.md)
			- Go until some version didn't have anything for [Monotonic Time](Apple%20Technologies/Apple%20Platform%20Cuncurrency/Monotonic%20Time.md). After they added it they're decided to keep monotonic and non-monotonic time in the same object, even if don't need them both ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
