- **Notes**
	- *Make your critical section as small as possible*
	- *Critical section* - section of code between call of `mutex.lock()` and `mutex.unlock()`
	- If you want to avoid *race conditions* make sure that every *mutable, shared* object in the system is either protected by `mutex` or `atomic`
