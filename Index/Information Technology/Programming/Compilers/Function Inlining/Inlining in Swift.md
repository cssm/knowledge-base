## General

**@inline** is used for internal inlining (in one module)

When the hell is doing this a good idea? According to the Apple engineers, the answer is **basically never.**

**@inlinable** is used for inlining methods when they will be used in another module (method implementation becomes a part of public interface of module i.e. body of function is added to module interface).

if **@inlinable** method is calling some internal method this method should be marked with `@inlinable` too or with `@usableFromInline`

advantages:

- you can boost up performance of using your methods from another module

disadvantages:

- increasing binary size
- changes API of module
    - canâ€™t use updated implementation of method without recompiling module that uses that method

## `@inlinable` vs `@inline(__always)`

- `@inlinable` is about visibility of functions body outside it's module
- `@inline(__always)` is about
    - Not changing module API
    - Consider not using `@inline(__always)` in general
        - It may be useful in cases where you're sure that this will increase performance
- Use `@inlinable` only for [Generics [Generics Specialisation in Swift](Generics%20Specialisation%20in%20Swift.md)

a function that is @inline(__always), but not @inlinable, will not be available for inlining outside of its module, because the function body that would be inlined is not available.

## `@usableFromInline`

Apply **@usableFromInline** attribute to a function, method, computed property, subscript, initializer, or deinitializer declaration to allow that symbol to be used in inlinable code thatâ€™s defined in the same module as the declaration. The declaration must have the **internal** access level modifier.

Like the public access level modifier, this attribute exposes the declaration as part of the moduleâ€™s public interface. Unlike public, the compiler doesnâ€™t allow declarations marked with usableFromInline to be referenced by name in code outside the module, even though the declarationâ€™s symbol is exported. However, code outside the module might still be able to interact with the declarationâ€™s symbol by using runtime behavior.

```swift
// âœ…
struct A {
    private var a = [[Int]]
    
    @usableFromInline 
    mutating func fa() {
        a.append(1)
    }
}

// ðŸ›‘
struct A {
    @usableFromInline
    private var a = [[Int]]
    
    mutating func fa() {
        a.append(1)
    }
}
```

## Example

```swift
public struct A {
    private var a = [[Int]]
    
    @usableFromInline // attributed exposes this method signature as part of public API
    mutating func fa() {
        a.append(1) // can access private stuff becouse body not exposed
    }
    
    @inlinable
    public mutating func la() {
        fa() // decared that body of function should be part of module public API, so fa() needs to be inlinable or usableFromInline
    }
}
```
