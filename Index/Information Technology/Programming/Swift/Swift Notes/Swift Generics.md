- **Notes**
	- Two ways of creating a generic function
		- Runtime-way (Boxing)
			- Uses only one version of function and passes info about `T` in metadata
			- Uses `Value Witness Table (VWT)` to extract this metadata
				- Generated at compile time for all types and contains all info about type needed for run time
			- If type constraints is used ( `func test<T: Equatable>(_ element: T)`) also `Protocol Witness Table (PWT)` is passed
		- Compile time way ([Generics Specialisation in Swift](Generics%20Specialisation%20in%20Swift.md))
	- `func get<T: Equatable>() -> T {}` == `func get<T>() -> T where T: Equatable {}`
