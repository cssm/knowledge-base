- One very important thing you should be aware of [mutexes in iOS](Apple%20Platform%20Concurrency.md) is that all of them are **unfair**. This means that unlike a serial `DispatchQueue`, locks like `os_unfair_lock` **make no guarantees in terms of the order** in which the different threads get to access it. This means that **one** single **thread could** theoretically **keep acquiring the lock over and over** indefinitely and leave the remaining threads waiting in a process referred to as starving. When evaluating locks, you should first determine whether or not this can be a problem in your case.
