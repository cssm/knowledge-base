- **Notes**
	- Allows to *continiusly handle different events without waiting*
	- Created automatic for the *main thread*
	- Handles *Input Sources* - async events from another threads or applications (UI touches and other stuff) and *Timer Sources* - synchronous events occurring at a scheduled time or repeating interval. 
	- `RunLoop` have *different modes* to handle different events and can *switch between* them
		- Basic modes
			- `Default` 
			- `UIHandling`
			- `Common`
		- Timer events by default handled in *Default mode*
		- UI events handled in *UIHandling mode* 
		- If `RunLoop` in one mode it *will not handle events from another mode*
			- Using timer while dragging slider -> [Timer will not work](https://programmer.ink/think/ios-development-runloop-understanding.html) because timers are handled in *Default mode*. We need to attach timer to *Common* mode to make it work
