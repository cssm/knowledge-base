# С++ Reference vs pointer

Basic difference it’s that reference is **just another name(alias) for variable** and they share same memory address, when pointer is a different variable with value that is equal to memory address of another variable. Also you can’t change reference to point to another variable. With pointers - you can.

**`References does not take any memory in contrast to pointers`**
