- **Notes**
	- Good alternative to [Shell Scripting](Shell%20Scripting.md) and [Python](Python.md) for scripting
	- `.lua`
	- All language is `~150kb`
		- Because of this it can be embedded in application directly  
	- Only one data structure mechanism `Table` that can be [Array](Array.md), [Dictionary](Dictionary.md) etc.
		- By default using `integer` indexes starting from `1` (i.e. it's and array)
			```lua
			local array = {"Apple", "Pineapple", "Orange"}
			```
	- Corouting's for multitasking 
	- `Luarocks` - package manager
