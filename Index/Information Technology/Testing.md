- **Notes**
	- *Fakes* is the general umbrella term for any kind of mock, fake, stub, double, etc
		- On their own, they typically have no implementation and only fulfill the interface API requirements of the types they are substituting.
	- *Stubs* are fakes that do some meaningful work thatâ€™s necessary for the objects involved in a test to operate, but not used for anything more than that. They canâ€™t be used in place of real production objects but can return stubbed values. They canâ€™t be asserted on.
	- *Mocks* are fakes that can be asserted on
		- Mocks are used in place of other objects just like a fake, but they themselves record some data such as the number of method calls or variables passed for your test to assert on later.
