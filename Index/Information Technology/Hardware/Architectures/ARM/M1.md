# M1

> New ARM based CPU from Apple that powers up mac's and [macOS](macOS.md) to new level

## Why `M1` beats everything ?

1. Optimised for reference count
2. High memory bandwidth
3. SoC (system on chip)
    1. A lot of specified cores
    2. Unified memory
        1. New Apples Unified Memory Architecture
        2. Instead of separate regions memory for CPU and GPU m1 has common ones and reuses them
4. 4x bigger instructions buffer
5. 8 (4 everyone else) of instructions decoder units
    1. This is allows to fill instructions buffer quicker then everyone on market today
6. Apple canâ€™t increase amount of GHz on there CPUs because this will produce more heat (new macbooks has a very good battery life and they like never turn they fans on) so they probably will increase amount of CPUs
