- *Category* - bunch (class) of objects + set of morphisms
	- *Elements Of Category*
		- *Objects*
			- primitive that has no properties (it's like a dot in mathematics, so we can't define what it is)
			- only exists to mark *morphisms*
			-  objects *can* form a set
				- if they do -> *small category*, if they don't -> *large category*
		- *Morphisms (arrows, maps)*
			- primitive that have beginning and end
			- `f: a -> b` - morphism `f` from object `a` to `b` 
			- morphisms between any two objects form a set
				- if they don't -> *high-order category* and this morphisms form objects in a category
	- *Definition Of Category*
		- *Composition Axiom*
			- If we have `f: a -> b` and `g: b -> c` then there's must exist morphism `g ∘ f: a -> c` that is a composition of `g` and `f`
				- Category is defined by this compositions that forms a *composition table*
					> Different composition tables will give you different categories. Objects and arrows don't contain any information, but composition contains the information
		- *Identity Axiom*
			-  For every object must have *identity morphism*
				-  For example for object `a` there always exists `id_a: a -> a`
			- if `f: a -> b`, and `id_a: a -> a` then `f ∘ id_a = f` (same morphism)
				- this called `right identity`
			- if `g: a -> b` and `id_b: b -> b` then `id_b ∘ g = g` (same morphism)
				- this called `left identity`
		- *Assiosativity Axiom*
			- if `f: a -> b`, `g: b -> c`, `h: c -> d` => `h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f` (same morphism)
				- some people call this composition of morphisms `weak identity` or `isomorphic` 
					> So what do you mean that two compositions are isomorphic? That means that there is a transformation that turns `h ∘ (g ∘ f)` into `(h ∘ g) ∘ f`, that is not an identity.
				- if morphisms are not defined by composition -> they always have identity (means that they are not the same)
					- `f: a -> b, g: a -> b` => `f != g`
					- `h ∘ (g ∘ f): a -> d, (h ∘ g) ∘ f: a -> d` => `h ∘ (g ∘ f) ~= (h ∘ g) ∘ f`, `~=` - weak identity, isomorphic
