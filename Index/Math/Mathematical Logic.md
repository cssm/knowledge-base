> Formalization of [Logic](Logic.md) in mathematical way

- **Notes**
	- *Axiom* - any proposition that is deemed "obviously true" by rote fiat
		- Example *Reflective Law of Equality* $A = A$
	- *Theorem* - any proposition formula derived from axioms via *rules of inference*
	- *Rules of Inference* - a propositional transformation that generates a new $True$ proposition out of old ones
		- Example *Transitive Law Of Equality*  : $A = B$ and $B = C$  $=> A = C$
